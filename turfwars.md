Turf Wars is a legendary arcade game you might know well already. Two teams, blue and red,fight each other to make the opposite team lose all its territory. Each territory consists of some number of lines. Both teams start with the same turf, and the one without any turf left loses the game..

During the build time, players can build defenses and can't attack. But when combat time begins, players can still build, but won't be safe as everybody can attack with their weapons!
